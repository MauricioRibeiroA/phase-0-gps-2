**hat Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
It wasnt exactly a git concept but I didnt know that when you have a repository at GitHub and you copy another person repo with the same the GitHub create a repo with a new name. As I did the GPS 1.1 exercise before the session starts I had this problem because I didnt know that I should look for the same repo with another name.
**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
The most interesting was to see the Merge Conflict for the first time and learn how the system allows you to fix it.
**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
About the Fetch command
**What still confuses you about Git?**
The fetch command
**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I was really confortable to know that a guide could help us at anytime. It optimizes the time
